Authors@R: c(person("Arni", "Magnusson", role=c("aut","cre"), email="thisisarni@gmail.com"))
Description: A simple make-like utility to run R scripts if needed, based on
  last modified time. Implemented in base R with no additional software
  requirements, organizational overhead, or structural requirements. In short:
  run an R script if underlying files have changed, otherwise do nothing.
